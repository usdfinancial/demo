# USD Financial Onboarding and Login Process

This document outlines the user onboarding (signup) and login processes for USD Financial. The two processes are designed to be distinct, with a simple and quick login for existing users and a comprehensive onboarding process for new users to ensure compliance and security.

## 1. Signup and Onboarding Process

The onboarding process is designed to be completed in a single, seamless flow.

### Step 1: Initial Signup

*   **Action:** The user provides their email address and creates a strong password.
*   **Rationale:** This is the first step to creating a user account.

### Step 2: Email Verification

*   **Action:** A verification link is sent to the user's email address. The user must click this link to proceed.
*   **Rationale:** This verifies that the user has access to the email address provided and is a standard security measure.

### Step 3: Personal Information (KYC - Know Your Customer)

*   **Action:** The user is required to provide the following personal information:
    *   Full legal name
    *   Date of birth
    *   Residential address
    *   Country of residence
*   **Rationale:** This information is required to comply with financial regulations (KYC/AML).

### Step 4: Identity Verification

*   **Action:** The user must upload a government-issued photo ID. This can be done by:
    *   Taking a photo of the ID using their device's camera.
    *   Uploading a high-quality image of the ID.
*   **Action:** The user must take a selfie.
*   **Rationale:** This is a critical step for identity verification and fraud prevention. The selfie is compared with the photo on the ID to ensure the user is who they claim to be.

### Step 5: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup

*   **Action:** The user is prompted to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for their account. The recommended method is using an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy). SMS-based 2FA is also available as an alternative.
*   **Rationale:** 2FA adds a crucial layer of security to the user's account, protecting it from unauthorized access.

### Step 6: Funding the Account

*   **Action:** Once the user's identity is verified, they can fund their account. The following options are available:
    *   Link a bank account via Plaid.
    *   Wire transfer.
    *   Deposit from an external crypto wallet.
*   **Rationale:** This is the final step for the user to start using the services offered by USD Financial.

## 2. Login Process

The login process is designed to be simple and quick for returning users.

### Step 1: Enter Credentials

*   **Action:** The user enters their email address and password.

### Step 2: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

*   **Action:** The user is prompted to enter the 2FA code from their authenticator app or SMS.

### Step 3: Access Granted
